# AI Influencer Creation Complete Workflow Guide

## Overview
This guide connects all the templates and provides a step-by-step workflow for creating a consistent AI influencer across images and videos.

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Character Design and Definition

#### Step 1.1: Complete Base Model Template
- Open `1_base_model_template.md`
- Fill out every section with specific details
- Be as precise as possible with measurements, colors, and descriptions
- Save completed template as `[CHARACTER_NAME]_base_model.md`

#### Step 1.2: Create Character Consistency Document
```markdown
# [CHARACTER_NAME] - Quick Reference

## Essential Features (Never Change)
- Face shape: [SPECIFIC_SHAPE]
- Eye color: [HEX_CODE] 
- Hair: [COLOR_TEXTURE_LENGTH]
- Skin tone: [SPECIFIC_UNDERTONES]
- Height/Build: [MEASUREMENTS]
- Distinctive features: [UNIQUE_CHARACTERISTICS]

## Personality Traits
- [KEY_TRAIT_1]
- [KEY_TRAIT_2] 
- [KEY_TRAIT_3]

## Style Preferences
- Color palette: [PREFERRED_COLORS]
- Clothing style: [STYLE_AESTHETIC]
- Makeup style: [NATURAL/GLAM/BOLD]
```

### Phase 2: Initial Image Generation

#### Step 2.1: Generate Reference Images
Using prompts from `2_image_generation_prompts.md`:

1. **Face Reference Set** (Generate 5 images):
   - Front-facing portrait
   - Three-quarter view (right)
   - Three-quarter view (left)
   - Profile view
   - Close-up beauty shot

2. **Full Body Reference Set** (Generate 3 images):
   - Standing pose (front)
   - Side view pose
   - Dynamic pose (walking/moving)

#### Step 2.2: Quality Control and Selection
- Review all generated images for consistency
- Select the best images that match your base model template
- Save selected images as reference set
- Document any variations or inconsistencies to avoid in future generations

#### Step 2.3: Create Image Prompt Library
Based on successful generations, create standardized prompts:

```markdown
# [CHARACTER_NAME] Standard Image Prompts

## Master Character Description
[COPY FROM SUCCESSFUL GENERATION]

## Tested Successful Prompts
### Portrait: [WORKING_PROMPT_1]
### Full Body: [WORKING_PROMPT_2]  
### Beauty Shot: [WORKING_PROMPT_3]

## Quality Settings That Work
- Camera: [SPECIFIC_CAMERA_MODEL]
- Lens: [SPECIFIC_LENS_SPECS]
- Lighting: [SUCCESSFUL_LIGHTING_SETUP]
```

### Phase 3: Video Generation Setup

#### Step 3.1: Video Character Consistency Testing
Using prompts from `3_veo3_video_generation_prompts.md`:

1. Generate 2-3 test videos with simple actions:
   - Standing and smiling
   - Walking forward
   - Turning head left to right

2. Check for consistency:
   - Facial features remain identical
   - Body proportions consistent
   - Hair moves naturally
   - Clothing fits properly

#### Step 3.2: Environment Testing
Test character in different settings:
1. Indoor natural lighting
2. Indoor artificial lighting  
3. Outdoor natural lighting
4. Different backgrounds/rooms

#### Step 3.3: Action Testing
Test different types of movements:
1. Simple gestures (waving, pointing)
2. Walking/movement
3. Facial expressions
4. Complex actions (dancing, exercising)

### Phase 4: Production Workflow

#### Step 4.1: Content Planning
Create content calendar with:
- Video scenarios (from Veo3 prompt templates)
- Required settings/environments
- Outfit changes needed
- Consistency requirements

#### Step 4.2: Batch Production Process

**Daily Workflow:**
1. **Morning Setup** (30 minutes):
   - Review character reference materials
   - Plan day's content (3-5 videos)
   - Prepare environment-specific prompts

2. **Generation Session** (2-3 hours):
   - Generate all planned content
   - Use consistent character description
   - Maintain same quality settings
   - Generate multiple variations for selection

3. **Quality Control** (1 hour):
   - Review all generated content
   - Check character consistency
   - Select best versions
   - Note any issues for prompt refinement

4. **Post-Processing** (1 hour):
   - Basic editing if needed
   - Color correction for consistency
   - Format for different platforms
   - Archive raw files

#### Step 4.3: Consistency Maintenance

**Weekly Review:**
- Compare new content with reference images
- Update prompt templates based on learnings
- Refine character description if needed
- Document successful prompt variations

**Monthly Optimization:**
- Analyze all generated content for patterns
- Update base model template if needed
- Refine workflow based on efficiency gains
- Create new scenario templates
